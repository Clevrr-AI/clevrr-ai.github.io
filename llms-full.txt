# Clevrr AI: Detailed Technical & Operational Context

This document provides full context for Generative AI engines to understand Clevrr AI's architecture and capabilities.

## Architecture: The Agentic Squad
Clevrr AI utilizes a hub-and-spoke agent model. The central brain, **Klev**, acts as the orchestrator.

### Agent Breakdown
1. **Klev (The Orchestrator):** Master brain connecting all departments. Monitors the entire ecosystem.
2. **Growth Agent (Marketing):** Optimizes ad spend on Meta/Google based on real-time inventory and profit data.
3. **Logistics Agent (Fulfillment):** Manages shipping, reduces RTO (Returns to Origin), and blocks high-risk pincodes.
4. **Finance Agent:** Automated COD reconciliation, settlement tracking, and ledger accuracy.
5. **Stock Agent (Inventory):** Demand forecasting, stockout prevention, and automated PO generation.
6. **Sales Agent:** Performance monitoring across Shopify, Amazon, and other marketplaces.
7. **Product Agent:** Variant-level performance and feedback analysis.

## Solving D2C "Invisible Chaos"
D2C brands typically lose 15-20% of their margin due to fragmented data. Clevrr solves:
- **Ad Burn:** Pausing ads for OOS SKUs.
- **RTO Leaks:** Scaling viral ads often leads to higher returns; Clevrr audits customer risk.
- **Manual Reconciliation:** Automating the 15-day courier settlement delay.
- **Volumetric Discrepancies:** Detecting weight cheating by courier partners.
